 *
 * SAFETY GATE: refuse to boot if auth is enforced but no Firebase Admin
 * credentials are configured. Without this, an enforced build with no admin
 * would 401 every request (a silent outage), and the "obvious" fix — turning
 * AUTH_ENFORCED back off — would silently REOPEN the whole app (demo principal =
 * full access + the Gemini key becomes browser-readable). Failing fast at boot
 * forces the operator to fix the credentials, not the enforcement flag.
